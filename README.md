# UnitTestTask
HOME TASK
As a basis for this home task, use Calculator-1.0.jar
1.	Write unit tests for the calculator jar  library (Calculator-1.0.jar)
•	Add Calculator-1.0.jar to your project reference;
•	Write tests using TestNG;
•	Each class should test only one method of the library;
•	Tests pre-conditions and post-conditions should be implemented with appropriate annotations;
•	Run tests in IDE;
•	For TestNG – create .xml configuration file and use it to run tests. Create at least one test group. Some tests can depend on this group, or this group can be used to exclude/include tests from launch using XML-suite;
•	Create parametrized tests (data-driven approach);
•	Configure and execute tests in parallel mode.
 
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
1.	A separate Unit Test class exists for each method of Calculator-1.0.jar;
2.	TestNG is used in home task;
3.	Tests have pre-conditions and post-conditions;
4.	Screenshots with results of running in IDE are available;
5.	Xml configuration exists for TestNG suite. This configuration allows use/run group of tests;
6.	Data-driven approach is demonstrated with TestNG features;
7.	Parallel execution of tests is demonstrated with TestNG features;

BONUS TASK
1.	Calculator-1.0.jar contains couple of defects. Find them
2.	Rewrite some tests using JUnit 5, parameterization, grouping, etc
